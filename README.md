# Symfony CMF Block Bundle [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/symfony-cmf/BlockBundle.png)](http://travis-ci.org/symfony-cmf/BlockBundle)

This bundle is part of the [Symfony Content Management Framework (CMF)](http://cmf.symfony.com/)
and licensed under the [MIT License](LICENSE).

The BlockBundle provides integration with SonataBlockBundle. It assists you in
managing fragments of contents, so-called blocks. What the BlockBundle does is
similar to what Twig does, but for blocks that are persisted in a database. Thus,
the blocks can be made editable for an editor.
